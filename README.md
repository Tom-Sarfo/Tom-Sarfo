ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!  

Iâ€™m **Thomas Sarfo**, a **Software Engineer** at **mPharma**, where I focus on building impactful tools and solutions to improve healthcare operations. My expertise lies in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Python**, and Iâ€™m highly proficient in frontend frameworks like **React** and **Remix** (currently known as React Router 7).  

As the **Lead Software Engineer** on mPharmaâ€™s **Bloom Formulary Tool** project, Iâ€™ve been instrumental in designing and delivering a critical tool that enhances operational efficiency. I also played a key role in replacing **SAP** with mPharmaâ€™s new **procurement tool**, a move that saved the company significant subscription costs while improving system performance and flexibility.  

Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems, optimizing workflows, and delivering high-quality software solutions that drive real-world impact. My work is a mix of innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning.  

- **Fun fact:** When Iâ€™m not coding, I channel my creativity into crafting and designing footwear. I love the process of bringing unique designs to life and creating something tangible with my hands.  

Feel free to explore my projects, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out for collaborations or discussions!
